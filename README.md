# Near-Beer
This is the first project.

As a beer enthusiast
I want to enter a specific location 
So that I can quickly find some of the most popular local breweries in that area. 

Near Beers is a website that allows the user to enter any city, state, or zip code, as well as, the number of breweries the user would like to see. Once the search results populate, the user can view the brewery's location on the map and their contact information. The user will also be able to star or add breweries to a favorites list, so that they can quickly pull up the info on the go.
